Project Description
This project utilizes the IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews for sentiment analysis tasks.=> (Available on Kaggle)
We employ the nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment model, available on Hugging Face, which is a powerful pre-trained model capable of classifying customer feedback across multiple languages.

Although the dataset focuses on movie reviews, the model can be easily adapted for various feedback classification tasks, including but not limited to:

Restaurant reviews

Product feedback

Service evaluations across different industries

You can follow the complete step-by-step implementation provided in the code to learn how to integrate this model into your own projects and elevate the quality and professionalism of your feedback classification systems.
